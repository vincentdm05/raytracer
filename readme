## Welcome to my Raytracer in one week~~end~~ (or two)
#### Thanks to Peter Shirley and his book _Ray Tracing in one weekend_ for making this exercise so easy.

### Compile
with `g++ -Wall -std=c++11 -o raytracer main.cpp`

### Run
with `./raytracer`

Example usage (for mac):
If `bin/` doesn't exist yet: `mkdir bin`
`g++ -Wall -std=c++11 -o bin/raytracer main.cpp && ./bin/raytracer > img.ppm && open img.ppm`
